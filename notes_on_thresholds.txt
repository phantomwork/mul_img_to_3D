Thresholds
==========


For a triangulated point X and projection P

 |x - P X| < t_pixels


For an homography between images

 |x1 - H x2| < 2 * t_pixels


For a triangulated point and bearing

 |b - R X - t| < t_angle


For a rotation between bearings

 |b1 - R b1| < 2 * t_angle




The threshold for image to image error has to be twice as big as the error for 3d to image.
This is because the triangulated 3D point could be in the midle of the two image poits

   x1 <-------> P X <-------> x2
          t             t

   x1 <---------------------> x2
               2 * t



To convert between t_pixel and t_angle, we need the focal length of the camera.
We have

 tan(t_angle) = t_pixels / focal_length

Here we arbitrarily assume that the threshold is given for a camera of focal length 1
Also tan(t) \approx t since for small t. So we simply have

 t_angle \approx t_pixels
