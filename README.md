OpenSfM
=======

## Overview
OpenSfM is a Structure from Motion library written in Python on top of [OpenCV][]. The library serves as a processing pipeline for reconstructing camera poses and 3D scenes from multiple images. It consists of basic modules for Structure from Motion (feature detection/matching, minimal solvers) with a focus on building a robust and scalable reconstruction pipeline. It also integrates external sensor (e.g. GPS, accelerometer) measurements for geographical alignment and robustness. A JavaScript viewer is provided to preview the models and debug the pipeline.  



## Dependencies

* [OpenCV][]
* [Ceres Solver][]
* [Boost Python][]
* [NumPy][], [SciPy][], [Networkx][], PyYAML, exifread

### Installing dependencies on MacOSX

Use

    brew tap homebrew/science
    brew install opencv
    brew install homebrew/science/ceres-solver
    brew install boost
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

Be sure to update your `PYTHONPATH` to include `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages` where OpenCV has been installed:

    export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH


### Installing dependencies on Ubuntu

 1. [OpenCV][] - Install by following the steps in the Ubuntu OpenCV  [installation guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenCV). An alternative instruction tested for Ubuntu 10.04 can be found at [OpenCV Docs](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html). OpenCV requires [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) among other things.

 2. [Ceres solver][] - Build Ceres according the [documentation](http://ceres-solver.org/building.html). Make sure to read the Linux note, follow the **shared library** instructions and compile Ceres with the -fPIC option. Install Ceres from the ceres-bin directory after `make` by:
 
        sudo make install

 3. [Boost Python][] - Install through apt-get:

        sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev

 4. [NumPy][], networkx, PyYaml, exifread - Install [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) and then run the following from the root of the project:

        sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

 5. [SciPy][] - Install [gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran) through apt-get and then install [SciPy][] with:

        sudo apt-get install gfortran
        sudo pip install scipy


## Building

    python setup.py build


## Running

An example dataset is available at `data/berlin`.

 1. Put some images in `data/DATASET_NAME/images/`
 2. Put config.yaml in `data/DATASET_NAME/config.yaml`
 3. Go to the root of the project and run `bin/run_all data/DATASET_NAME`
 4. Start an http server from the root with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
 5. Browse `http://localhost:8000/viewer/reconstruction.html#file=/data/DATASET_NAME/reconstruction.json`.

Things you can do from there:
- Use datasets with more images
- Click twice on an image to see it. Then use arrows to move between images.
- Run `bin/mesh data/berlin` to build a reconstruction with sparse mesh that will produce smoother transitions from images
