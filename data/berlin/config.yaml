# Params for features
feature_type: SURF            # Feature type (SURF, SIFT)
feature_min_frames: 5000      # If fewer frames are detected, sift_peak_threshold/surf_hessian_threshold is reduced.
feature_process_size: 2048    # Resize the image if its size is larger than specified. Set to -1 for original size

# Params for SIFT
sift_peak_threshold: 0.1      # Smaller value -> more features
sift_edge_threshold: 10       # See OpenCV doc

# Params for SURF
surf_hessian_threshold: 3000  # Smaller value -> more features
surf_n_octaves: 4             # See OpenCV doc
surf_n_octavelayers: 2        # See OpenCV doc

# Params for general matching
lowes_ratio: 0.6              # Ratio test for matches

# Params for FLANN matching
flann_branching: 16           # See OpenCV doc
flann_iterations: 10          # See OpenCV doc
flann_checks: 100             # Smaller -> Faster (but might lose good matches)

# Params for preemptive matching
preemptive_max: 200           # Number of features to use for preemptive matching
preemptive_threshold: 4       # If number of matches passes the threshold -> full feature matching

# Params for geometric estimation
robust_matching_threshold: 3  # Outlier threshold (in pixels) for fundamental matrix estimation
five_point_algo_threshold: 5  # Outlier threshold (in pixels) for essential matrix estimation

# Other params
processes: 1                  # Number of threads to use
